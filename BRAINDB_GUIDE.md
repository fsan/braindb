# BrainDB — LLM Agent Usage Guide

This is the memory system you (the LLM) can use to store and retrieve knowledge across sessions.
The API runs at **http://localhost:8000**. Everything is done via HTTP calls.

---

## ⚠ TOOL PRIORITY (read this first)

BrainDB's value is the graph + embeddings + ranking. Use that power; do not
fall back to flat SQL.

1. **`POST /api/v1/memory/context`** — default for **query-driven** recall,
   discovery, understanding ("what do we know about X?"). Keyword-mediated
   fuzzy + embeddings + graph + ranking.
2. **`GET /api/v1/memory/tree/<id>?max_depth=N`** — reveals an entity's
   neighbourhood as a nested JSON tree (root keyed by `entity_type`,
   `children` arrays per node, keyword + retired-wiki noise filtered,
   `_truncated` last-child marker if more remain). Especially useful when
   you have an entity ID and want its graph context. On hub entities
   (wikis with many connections) pass `max_depth=3` for narrative chains.
3. **`POST /api/v1/agent/query`** ("delegate to a subagent") — for multi-step
   investigation / disambiguation.
4. `GET /api/v1/entities…` and `/entities/<id>/relations` — direct lookups.
5. **`POST /api/v1/memory/sql` ⚠ exception only** — aggregates (counts,
   GROUP BY, activity-log joins). NEVER for recall, discovery, similarity,
   understanding, or "what's around this entity" — those are the tools above.

## Entity Types

| Type | What to store |
|------|--------------|
| `thought` | Inferences, hypotheses, observations — subjective, may be uncertain |
| `fact` | Objective information with a certainty score |
| `source` | URLs and links to external information |
| `datasource` | Full documents or files with rich content |
| `rule` | Behavioral guidelines for how you should act (THIS type) |

---

## Core Workflow

### Before answering anything non-trivial, always call:
```
POST /api/v1/memory/context
{"queries": ["bare-keyword-1", "bare-keyword-2", "one broader phrase"], "max_depth": 3}
```
This returns:
- Direct matches (keyword-mediated fuzzy + keyword-mediated embedding) across all queries
- Graph-connected entities up to 3 hops away (relevance fades: 100% -> 60% -> 30%)
- Two-level diversity quota applied: per-search-term reservation (each query gets a guaranteed share) + per-keyword halving cap on the open remainder
- Always-on rules (always injected regardless of query)

Each item has a `final_rank` score. Trust higher-ranked items more. `max_results` defaults to 30; the scoring pool internally considers up to 500 candidates per query so narrow keywords aren't excluded before they're evaluated.

**Query strategy.** Prefer **multiple narrow queries** (single keywords, bare names) over one long sentence. Keywords are short, so a short query matches them at high pg_trgm similarity; a long phrase dilutes the trigram set and pushes narrow-subject facts down the ranking. Examples:

```
GOOD:  "queries": ["Petros", "Selonda Saronikos fish farm", "Dimitrios manager"]
BAD:   "queries": ["Petros person identity profile relation to Dimitris"]
```

The per-search-term quota reserves slots for each query you pass, so the bare-keyword query is guaranteed to surface its specific facts even when paired with broader angles. Single `query` (string) still works for backward compatibility.

### After learning something new, save it:
```
POST /api/v1/entities/facts      — for objective facts
POST /api/v1/entities/thoughts   — for your inferences/opinions
POST /api/v1/entities/sources    — for URLs you encounter
POST /api/v1/entities/rules      — for new behavioral guidelines
```

### Connect related items with relations:
```
POST /api/v1/relations
```
Relation types: `supports`, `contradicts`, `elaborates`, `refers_to`, `derived_from`, `similar_to`, `is_example_of`, `challenges`

## API Reference

### List / Filter Entities
```bash
# List all facts
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?entity_type=fact&limit=50

# Filter by keyword
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?keyword=user-profile&limit=50

# Filter by provenance source
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?source=user-stated&limit=50

# Filter by minimum importance
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?min_importance=0.7&limit=20

# Combine filters
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?entity_type=fact&source=user-stated&keyword=expertise&limit=20"
```
Query parameters: `entity_type`, `keyword`, `source`, `min_importance` (0-1), `limit` (1-200, default 50), `offset` (default 0).

### Get Entity by ID
The **only full-content read**. Multi-item calls (context/search/list) return
~1K previews ending `--truncated … get_entity("<id>")`; come here for the
whole body.
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/<UUID>
# Large body? page it (don't pull it whole):
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/<UUID>?offset=0&limit=8000"
```
With `offset`/`limit` the response adds `content_meta`:
`{total_chars, offset, returned, next_offset}` — keep fetching `next_offset`
until it is `null`. Default (no params) = full body, unchanged. For big
documents, prefer delegating the read to a subagent via `/api/v1/agent/query`
so the content never floods the caller's context.

### Delete Entity
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/<UUID>
```
Returns 204. Cascades to relations.

### Create a Fact
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/facts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "The fact you want to store",
    "title": "Short title (optional)",
    "certainty": 0.9,
    "is_verified": false,
    "source": "user-stated",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "importance": 0.7,
    "notes": "Why you saved this, any caveats"
  }'
```

### Create a Thought
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/thoughts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Your inference or observation",
    "certainty": 0.6,
    "context": "What triggered this thought",
    "emotional_valence": 0.0,
    "keywords": ["topic"],
    "importance": 0.5
  }'
```

### Create a Rule
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/rules \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "The rule text",
    "always_on": true,
    "category": "behavior|ethics|personality|task|constraint",
    "priority": 80,
    "importance": 0.9
  }'
```
Rules with `always_on: true` are **always** returned with every context call (up to top 10 by priority).

### Create a Source (URL)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/sources \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Description of what this source contains",
    "title": "Article title",
    "url": "https://...",
    "domain": "example.com",
    "keywords": ["topic"],
    "importance": 0.6
  }'
```

### Create a Datasource (full document)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/datasources \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Full document text or summary",
    "title": "Document title",
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.md",
    "keywords": ["topic"],
    "importance": 0.7
  }'
```

### Update Any Entity (PATCH)
All 5 entity types support PATCH. Only send the fields you want to change:
```bash
# Update a fact
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/facts/<UUID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Updated observation", "importance": 0.9}'

# Update a thought
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/thoughts/<UUID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"certainty": 0.8}'

# Update a rule
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/rules/<UUID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"always_on": true, "priority": 90}'

# Also: /entities/sources/<UUID>, /entities/datasources/<UUID>
```

### Create a Relation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/relations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_entity_id": "<UUID>",
    "to_entity_id": "<UUID>",
    "relation_type": "supports",
    "relevance_score": 0.8,
    "importance_score": 0.7,
    "is_bidirectional": false,
    "description": "Why this relation exists",
    "notes": "Any evolving observations"
  }'
```

### Get Entity Relations
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/<UUID>/relations
```
Returns all relations where the entity is either `from` or `to`.

### Get / Update / Delete a Relation
```bash
# Get
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/relations/<UUID>

# Update
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/v1/relations/<UUID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"relevance_score": 0.9, "notes": "stronger connection than initially thought"}'

# Delete
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/relations/<UUID>
```

### Search (fast, no graph traversal)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "your query", "limit": 10}'
```

### Context (full retrieval — use this for most things)

**Multi-query** (recommended — covers multiple angles in one call):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "queries": ["user-profile", "expertise", "project-decision"],
    "max_depth": 3,
    "include_always_on_rules": true
  }'
```

Each query runs through TWO keyword-mediated pathways in parallel:
- **Fuzzy** — `pg_trgm similarity(content, query)` over keyword entities.
- **Embedding** — Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (1024-dim) cosine similarity between the query and keyword-entity embeddings.

Entities surface via `tagged_with` from the matched keywords. Per-entity score = `max(matched-keyword similarity)` on each pathway. Both signals are merged with the geometric mean (configurable `missing_signal_penalty` when only one signal fires).

After scoring, **two diversity quotas** apply:
1. **Per-search-term** — each query in `queries[]` reserves `ceil(max_results × per_query_share / num_queries)` slots filled from its own top-ranked entities. Knob: `per_query_share` (default 0.5; set to 0 to disable).
2. **Per-keyword (halving)** — walking the remaining slots in `final_rank`-desc order, each new dominant keyword gets a halving allowance (50% / 25% / 12.5% ..., floor 1). Knob: `keyword_quota_halving` (default 0.5; set to 1.0 to disable).

`max_results` defaults to 30 (LLM-visible cap). The internal scoring pool considers up to 500 keyword neighbours per query (`scoring_pool_keyword_neighbors`) and up to 500 fuzzy candidates (`scoring_pool_fuzzy`) — cheap pure-SQL/vector work, so narrow keywords aren't excluded before they're evaluated. None of these knobs are env-driven; tune them in [`braindb/config.py`](braindb/config.py) if needed.

**Single query** (backward-compatible):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "your query", "max_depth": 3, "max_results": 30}'
```

### Entity Tree (explore connections)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/tree/<UUID>?max_depth=2
```
Returns the entity and its 1-N hop neighbourhood as a nested JSON tree (root
keyed by `entity_type`, `children` arrays per node, multi-path first-wins by
best accumulated path score, keyword + retired-wiki noise filtered by default).
Optional query params: `include_keywords` (default `false`), `top_k` (default
`40`), `min_path_score` (default `0.0`). A `_truncated` last-child marker
appears when `top_k` clips the result.

### Get All Rules
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/rules
```

### Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/stats
```

### Activity Log
Every create, update, delete, search, context, ingest, and SQL query is logged. Query to reconstruct history.

```bash
# Recent activity
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?limit=20"

# Filter by operation (create, update, delete, search, context, ingest, sql_query)
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?operation=create&limit=20"

# History for a specific entity
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?entity_id=<UUID>"

# Since a timestamp
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?since=2026-04-08T00:00:00Z"
```

Response includes: `id`, `timestamp`, `operation`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `details`, `context_note`.

### Read-only SQL — EXCEPTION tool, not for recall

⚠ This is **not** a recall/discovery path. A flat SELECT has no embeddings, no
graph, no ranking — it discards everything BrainDB is built for. Default to
`POST /api/v1/memory/context` (and delegated `/api/v1/agent/query`) for all
recall, discovery, and understanding. Use `/memory/sql` **only** for a
specific structured/aggregate question those cannot express (counts, GROUP BY,
activity-log joins). Only `SELECT` and `WITH` queries; 5s timeout; 1000 row limit.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/sql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT entity_type, COUNT(*) FROM entities GROUP BY entity_type"}'
```

Response: `{"columns": [...], "rows": [[...]], "row_count": N, "elapsed_ms": X}`

### Ingest a File as Datasource
Read a file from disk, hash it, count words, create a datasource entity.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/datasources/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file_path": "data/sources/article.md",
    "keywords": ["finance", "ml"],
    "importance": 0.7,
    "source": "document"
  }'
```

`file_path` is resolved relative to the repo root (mounted at `/app` in the container). Max 5 MB per file.

### BrainDB Agent — natural language queries

`POST /api/v1/agent/query` — instead of orchestrating individual API calls, send a plain English request and let BrainDB's internal agent handle it. The agent uses the OpenAI Agents SDK with LiteLLM (provider pluggable via `LLM_PROFILE` — **`deepinfra` with `google/gemma-4-31B-it` is the recommended default**; `nim` and local vLLM are also supported) and has access to all 21 BrainDB operations as function tools.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What do you know about the user role and recent projects?"}'
# {"answer": "The user is ...", "max_turns": 20}
```

(`max_turns` is optional; the default — currently 20 — is used when omitted.)

**Save via the agent**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Save: user prefers simple code over abstractions. Source: user-stated. Connect to existing preference entities."}'
```

**Delegate to a subagent** (keeps main agent context clean for heavy work):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Delegate to a subagent: find near-duplicate facts and return top 10 pairs with their IDs."}'
```

The agent has these tools internally: `recall_memory`, `quick_search`, `save_fact`, `save_thought`, `save_source`, `save_rule`, `ingest_file`, `get_entity`, `list_entities`, `update_entity`, `delete_entity`, `create_relation`, `view_entity_relations`, `delete_relation`, `view_tree`, `search_sql`, `view_log`, `get_stats`, `generate_embeddings`, `delegate_to_subagent`, `final_answer`.

**Setup (pick a provider)**:
- **DeepInfra — recommended default**: set `LLM_PROFILE=deepinfra` and `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=...` in `.env`. Fast (5–30s per agent call), cheap, validated end-to-end. Get a key at https://deepinfra.com/
- **NVIDIA NIM** (free-tier alternative): set `LLM_PROFILE=nim` and `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY=...` in `.env`. Get a key at https://build.nvidia.com/
- **Self-hosted vLLM** (advanced / offline / requires GPU workstation): set `LLM_PROFILE=vllm_workstation` (or `..._qwen`, `..._gemma`) — points at a vLLM server bound to the Docker host's loopback at `:8002` / `:8010` / `:8009` respectively. Reach it from the docker network via an SSH tunnel if the GPU is on a remote machine. No API key needed if the server runs without auth. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to add your own self-hosted profile.
- Profiles live in `braindb/config.py::_LLM_PROFILES`. Add new providers there (e.g. `together`, `openai`) by adding a dict entry — no code change required.
- Optional override: set `AGENT_MODEL=` in `.env` to use a non-default model for the active profile.

**Verbose logging**: set `AGENT_VERBOSE=true` in `.env` to log every tool call to stdout (visible via `docker logs braindb_api -f`). The HTTP response stays clean — only `answer` and `max_turns`.

**Encoding**: when constructing the JSON body, use ASCII characters only (plain hyphens `-`, no em-dashes `—`). On Windows shells, special characters may get mangled and the server returns 400 Bad Request.

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status": "ok", "embeddings": true}
```

## Scoring Fields

| Field | Range | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `importance` | 0-1 | How important this entity is overall |
| `certainty` | 0-1 | How confident you are (thoughts/facts) |
| `relevance_score` | 0-1 | How relevant a relation is |
| `emotional_valence` | -1 to 1 | Negative to positive sentiment (thoughts only) |
| `priority` | 1-100 | Rule priority (higher = more important) |

---

## Provenance — Tracking Where Information Came From

Every entity has an optional `source` field that tracks its origin:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `user-stated` | The user explicitly said this |
| `agent-inference` | The agent inferred or observed this |
| `document` | Extracted from a file or document |
| `third-party` | Came from another person, system, or API |

Set `source` when creating any entity. Filter with `GET /entities?source=user-stated`.

This is complementary to `source_entity_id` (on facts — links to a specific source entity) and `derived_from` relations (graph connections). Use `source` for the KIND of origin, `source_entity_id` for WHICH specific entity, and relations for HOW they connect.

---

## How Search Works

Two different paths, two different scoring models:

**`POST /api/v1/memory/search`** (and the `quick_search` agent tool) — **content-matching** with a 4-tier score against entity content directly:
1. **Full-text AND match** (all query words match) — highest weight (1.0)
2. **Full-text OR match** (any query word matches) — lower weight (0.3)
3. **Content trigram similarity** — fuzzy character matching (0.5)
4. **Title trigram similarity** — fuzzy title matching (0.3)

This is for "find me entities whose CONTENT mentions these terms" — useful for arbitrary text matching, but it dilutes when the query is much longer than what's in the entity.

**`POST /api/v1/memory/context`** (the sophisticated path) — **keyword-mediated**. Both the fuzzy and embedding pathways match the query against keyword entities (not entity bodies); entities surface via `tagged_with`. Then graph traversal, decay, two-level diversity quota, ranking. See the "Context" section above for the full pipeline.

Use `/memory/search` for raw text matching; use `/memory/context` for everything that involves *understanding* a subject. If you get 0 results from either, reformulate with more specific terms.

---

## Decay Behaviour

Memories fade over time (older = lower effective importance), but strengthen when accessed.
- Thoughts decay fastest (0.5%/day)
- Facts decay slowly (0.1%/day)
- Rules never decay

The `final_rank` in context results already accounts for decay.

---

## Categories for Rules

- `behavior` — how you act and communicate
- `ethics` — moral constraints
- `personality` — tone, style, character
- `task` — task-specific instructions
- `constraint` — hard limits

---

## Tips

1. **Keywords matter** — the more precise your keywords, the better retrieval works. Include both full terms and abbreviations: `["machine-learning", "ML"]`
2. **Relations are powerful** — linking entities enables graph traversal; a fact connected to a rule will surface that rule when the fact is found
3. **Notes are a log** — use `notes` on any entity to record how your understanding evolved
4. **always_on rules are limited to 10** — keep them high-signal; use on-demand rules for specifics
5. **access_count reinforces memory** — things you retrieve often stay important longer
6. **Multi-query for better recall** — use `queries` (array) instead of `query` (single) AND prefer multiple **narrow** queries (single keywords / bare names) over one long phrase. Each query in `queries[]` reserves a share of result slots, so a bare keyword is guaranteed to surface its facts. `max_results` defaults to 30.
7. **Content should be concise** — 1-2 sentences, standalone, using full terms (not abbreviations)
8. **Use the tree endpoint** to explore how an entity connects to others: `GET /memory/tree/<id>`
9. **Use the list endpoint** to browse entities: `GET /entities?entity_type=fact&limit=50`
