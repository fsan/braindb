## BrainDB — Persistent Memory System

You have access to a persistent memory database at `http://localhost:8000`. Use it to remember things about the user across sessions.

### Health check and always-on rules:
!`curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/rules || echo "BRAINDB_DOWN"`

### Skill version sync:
!`REPO=$(cat ~/.claude/skills/braindb/.repo_path 2>/dev/null); if [ -n "$REPO" ] && [ -f "$REPO/skills/braindb/SKILL.md" ] && ! diff -q ~/.claude/skills/braindb/SKILL.md "$REPO/skills/braindb/SKILL.md" > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo "SKILL_UPDATE_AVAILABLE: $REPO/skills/braindb/SKILL.md"; fi`

**If the output above contains `SKILL_UPDATE_AVAILABLE`**, a newer version of this skill exists in the local braindb repo (updated via `git pull`). Update it now:
```bash
cp <path shown in the output>/skills/braindb/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/braindb/SKILL.md
```
Tell the user: "I've updated the braindb skill to the latest version from the repo. The update will take effect on the next skill invocation." Then continue with the current task normally.

---

**If the output above contains `BRAINDB_DOWN`**, the memory database is not running. Do this:

#### Step 1 — Ask the user
> BrainDB isn't running. Do you want me to start it for you?

#### Step 2 — Find the braindb repo

A braindb repo is identified by having **ALL** of these:
- A `docker-compose.yml` at the root
- A `braindb/` Python package directory (contains `main.py`)
- A `pyproject.toml` whose `name = "braindb"`

Search in this order:
1. The current working directory: does `./docker-compose.yml` exist AND `./braindb/main.py` exist?
2. Parent directories up to 3 levels
3. Common locations (use the Glob tool):
   - `~/source/repos/**/braindb/docker-compose.yml`
   - `~/repos/**/braindb/docker-compose.yml`
   - `~/projects/**/braindb/docker-compose.yml`
4. If still not found, ask the user for the absolute path.

#### Step 3 — Start it and cache the repo path

From the braindb repo root:
```bash
cd <braindb-repo-path> && docker compose up -d
```

This builds if needed and starts the `braindb_api` container. The container runs `alembic upgrade head` on startup, then `uvicorn braindb.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.

**Also save the repo path** so future skill invocations can check for updates:
```bash
echo "<braindb-repo-path>" > ~/.claude/skills/braindb/.repo_path
```

**Note**: the first start (build) can take 1-2 minutes. Subsequent starts take ~5 seconds.

#### Step 4 — Wait and verify

```bash
# Wait up to 30 seconds for it to come up
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6; do
  sleep 5
  curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
done
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health
```

If the final curl returns `{"status":"ok"}`, you're live.

#### Step 5 — Proceed or fall back

- **If healthy**: continue with the recall workflow below.
- **If user declined** or the start failed: proceed with the task WITHOUT memory. Don't keep retrying. Don't block the conversation.

#### Troubleshooting if startup fails

- `docker compose up -d` fails with "network not found" → the compose file references an external network. Check `docker network ls` for `local-network`, create if missing: `docker network create local-network`.
- `alembic upgrade head` fails → the database connection from `.env` isn't reachable. Tell the user to check `.env` and that their PostgreSQL is running.
- Health check never responds → check logs: `docker logs braindb_api --tail 30`

## TOOL PRIORITY (read this first)

BrainDB's power is the graph + embeddings + ranking. Use it; do not fall back
to flat SQL.

1. **`POST /api/v1/memory/context`** (multi-query) — the default for ALL
   recall, discovery, and understanding: fuzzy + full-text + **keyword
   embedding** + graph traversal + decay + ranking.
2. **`POST /api/v1/agent/query` with "delegate to a subagent…"** — for
   multi-step investigation/disambiguation; the agent researches and returns a
   summary.
3. `GET /api/v1/entities…`, `GET /api/v1/memory/tree/<id>`,
   `GET /api/v1/entities/<id>/relations` — targeted structure lookups.
4. **`POST /api/v1/memory/sql` — exception only.** A flat SELECT has no
   embeddings/graph/ranking. Use it solely for a specific structured/aggregate
   question (counts, GROUP BY, activity-log joins) the above cannot express.
   **Never** for recall, discovery, similarity, or understanding.

If you're about to use `/memory/sql` to *find* or *understand* something,
stop — that's a `/memory/context` (or delegated `/agent/query`) job.

### Previews vs full body

`/memory/context` (and `/memory/search`, `GET /entities`) return **short
previews** per item (~1K); a clipped item ends with
`--truncated (N more) -- full body: get_entity("<id>")`. That's intended —
decide from previews, then read only what you need:

- Full single entity: `GET /api/v1/entities/{id}`.
- Large body: page it — `GET /api/v1/entities/{id}?offset=0&limit=8000`, then
  follow `content_meta.next_offset` until it is `null`. For big documents,
  prefer `POST /api/v1/agent/query` with "delegate to a subagent to read and
  distil entity <id>" so the heavy content never enters this conversation.

## RECALL — Before Responding

### Step 1: Formulate targeted queries

Analyze the user's message. Extract the **core topics** that need memory context. Create **multiple targeted queries** — do NOT paste the raw user message.

**Important**: Use terms that match how entities are STORED, not natural language questions. The search uses trigram similarity + full-text matching. Specific terms that would appear in stored content work best. Vague queries with stop words ("everything about X") will return nothing.

Include likely keywords in your queries: `user-profile`, `expertise`, `project-decision`, `user-preference`.

Examples:

| User says | Queries |
|-----------|---------|
| "help me refactor this React component" | `["user-profile React frontend expertise", "user-preference code style refactoring"]` |
| "let's work on the IR pipeline" | `["investor-relations IR scraping architecture", "user-preference deployment workflow"]` |
| (new conversation, no specific topic) | `["user-profile expertise role background", "user-preference working style"]` |
| "what's the best way to deploy this?" | `["deployment infrastructure project-decision", "user-preference production services"]` |

Always include a `"user-profile"` query on the first message of a conversation — you need to know who you're talking to.

### Step 2: Call the multi-query context endpoint

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"queries": ["query1", "query2"], "max_depth": 3, "max_results": 15}'
```

### Step 3: Evaluate results and retry if weak

If you got **0 results**, your query terms didn't match stored content. Reformulate with more specific terms that would actually appear in entity content or keywords.

**If results are weak — Retry 1:** Reformulate queries with different terms.
- "machine learning" missed? Try `"ML artificial intelligence data science"`
- Too specific? Broaden: `"user-profile technical background"` instead of `"user-profile Python metaprogramming"`
- Too broad? Narrow: `"React hooks state management"` instead of `"frontend development"`

**If still weak — Retry 2:** Final broad sweep:
```json
{"queries": ["user-profile expertise", "project-decision", "user-preference"], "max_results": 15}
```

After 2 retries, accept what you have and proceed.

### Step 4: Use results naturally

**NEVER paste raw JSON API responses into the conversation.** Parse results silently and use the content to inform your response. When you need to show the user what's in memory, format it as clean bullet points or a markdown table — not JSON.

Let recalled facts inform your response. **Do NOT announce** "I found in memory that..." unless sharing the memory is directly relevant. If you know the user is senior in ML, calibrate your explanations accordingly — don't narrate that you remembered it.

---

## SAVE — After Responding

After each interaction, evaluate what you learned. **Be proactive and thorough about saving.**

### Saving philosophy

- **Save everything worth remembering.** Don't skip something because it seems minor — save it with lower importance. A fact you didn't need is harmless. A fact you forgot is a missed opportunity.
- **Create THOUGHTS proactively.** After each interaction, form inferences: what does this tell you about the user's expertise? Their working style? Their priorities? Thoughts are cheap and enrich the graph.
- **Create RELATIONS for every new entity.** Connect it to existing entities found during recall. Multiple relations per entity is ideal — the graph's value comes from density.

### What to save as

| Information | Type | Certainty | Importance | Source | Required keywords |
|-------------|------|-----------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Core identity (role, company) | fact | 0.9 | 0.9 | `user-stated` | `"user-profile"` |
| Strong expertise area | fact | 0.8-0.9 | 0.8 | `user-stated` | `"user-profile"`, `"expertise"` |
| Preference / working style | fact | 0.7-0.8 | 0.7 | `user-stated` | `"user-preference"` |
| Behavioral correction | rule | — | 0.8 | `user-stated` | category: `"behavior"` |
| Project decision | fact | 0.7-0.9 | 0.6-0.8 | `user-stated` | `"project-decision"` |
| Your inference about user | thought | 0.5-0.7 | 0.5 | `agent-inference` | `"inference"` |
| Casual mention | fact | 0.5-0.6 | 0.4 | `user-stated` | topic-specific |
| URL / reference | source | — | 0.5-0.7 | varies | topic-specific |
| Local file / document / dataset | datasource | — | 0.6-0.8 | `document` | topic-specific |
| Info from another person/system | fact | 0.6-0.8 | 0.5-0.7 | `third-party` | topic-specific |

### How to save

```bash
# Save a fact (user told you something)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/facts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "...", "certainty": 0.8, "source": "user-stated", "keywords": ["user-profile", "topic"], "importance": 0.7}'

# Save a thought (your inference)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/thoughts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "...", "certainty": 0.6, "source": "agent-inference", "context": "what triggered this inference", "keywords": ["inference", "topic"], "importance": 0.5}'

# Save a behavioral rule
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/rules \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "...", "source": "user-stated", "category": "behavior", "priority": 70, "always_on": false, "keywords": ["user-preference", "topic"], "importance": 0.8}'

# Save a source (URL bookmark — external links, web pages)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/sources \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "description of the source", "source": "third-party", "url": "https://...", "keywords": ["topic"], "importance": 0.5}'

# Save a datasource (file, document, or dataset with content to read)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/datasources \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "description of the file/document", "source": "document", "file_path": "/path/to/file", "keywords": ["topic"], "importance": 0.6}'
```

**source vs datasource**: Use `source` for lightweight URL bookmarks. Use `datasource` for local files, documents, datasets — anything with a `file_path` or content to read.

### Content guidelines

- **Concise**: 1-2 sentences max. Write `"Dimitris has 10+ years Python experience, primarily data science and ML."` — not a paragraph.
- **Full terms in content**: Write "machine learning" not "ML". Put abbreviations in keywords: `["machine-learning", "ML"]`.
- **Standalone**: Content must make sense without this conversation. Write `"Prefers simple code over abstractions"` — not `"User said they don't like what I did."`
- **Both forms in keywords**: Include full terms AND abbreviations: `["machine-learning", "ML", "artificial-intelligence", "AI"]`.

### Before saving: check for duplicates

Look at your recall results. If a fact already exists covering the same information:
- **Skip** if identical
- **Update notes** on the existing entity via PATCH if the new info adds nuance
- **Create new** only if genuinely different information

### After saving: create relations

Connect every new entity to at least one existing entity found during recall:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/relations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from_entity_id": "<new_id>", "to_entity_id": "<existing_id>", "relation_type": "elaborates", "relevance_score": 0.7, "description": "why these are related"}'
```

Relation types: `supports`, `contradicts`, `elaborates`, `refers_to`, `derived_from`, `similar_to`, `is_example_of`, `challenges`

### Finding relation targets beyond recall

Recall is scoped to the current conversation topic. Good relation targets often exist outside those results. Before settling for no relations, actively search for candidates:

- List entities by keyword: `curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?keyword=user-profile&limit=30"`
- List by type: `curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?entity_type=fact&limit=30"`
- Check existing relations: `curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/<UUID>/relations`
- Explore the graph tree: `curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/tree/<UUID>?max_depth=2`

### Use a subagent for relation discovery

To avoid polluting your main context with large JSON results, **delegate relation discovery to a subagent**. The subagent searches BrainDB, finds candidates, creates the relations, and returns a brief summary. Your main context stays clean.

Spawn a subagent with a task like:
> "Search BrainDB for entities that should be related to this new entity: [content summary].
> Check `GET /api/v1/entities?entity_type=fact&limit=30` and `GET /api/v1/entities?entity_type=thought&limit=30`.
> For each good match, create a relation via `POST /api/v1/relations` with appropriate type and relevance.
> Return a summary of relations created (entity IDs, types, descriptions)."

This pattern keeps the graph dense without flooding the main conversation.

### What NOT to save

- Ephemeral task details (specific error messages, temp file paths, "currently debugging X")
- Things already in the database (you just checked!)
- Information that will be stale by next session

---

## EXPLORE — Listing and Browsing

### List entities by type / keyword / source
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?entity_type=fact&limit=50"
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?keyword=user-profile&limit=50"
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities?source=user-stated&limit=50"
```

### View entity relations
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/<UUID>/relations
```

### Explore entity graph tree
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/tree/<UUID>?max_depth=2
```

### Delete an entity or relation
```bash
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/<UUID>
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/relations/<UUID>
```

### Activity log — when and how things happened

Every create/update/delete/search/context/ingest is logged. Query it to understand history and context.

```bash
# Recent activity (last 20)
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?limit=20"

# Filter by operation
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?operation=create&limit=20"
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?operation=ingest&limit=20"

# History for a specific entity
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?entity_id=<UUID>"

# Since a timestamp
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/log?since=2026-04-08T00:00:00Z"
```

Use this to answer "when did I learn this?" or "what was I working on yesterday?"

### Read-only SQL — EXCEPTION tool, aggregations only

⚠ Not a recall/discovery tool (see TOOL PRIORITY at the top). A flat SELECT
throws away embeddings, graph and ranking — everything BrainDB is good at.
Use it **only** for a specific structured/aggregate question the dedicated
endpoints cannot express (counts, GROUP BY, activity-log joins). For finding
or understanding anything, use `/memory/context` or a delegated `/agent/query`.
Only `SELECT` and `WITH` queries are allowed; 5s timeout; 1000 row limit.

```bash
# Count entities by source
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/sql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT source, COUNT(*) FROM entities GROUP BY source"}'

# Find high-importance facts added recently
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/sql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT id, content FROM entities WHERE importance > 0.7 AND created_at > now() - interval \"7 days\" ORDER BY created_at DESC"}'

# Join log with entities
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memory/sql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT l.timestamp, l.operation, e.content FROM activity_log l JOIN entities e ON e.id = l.entity_id ORDER BY l.timestamp DESC LIMIT 20"}'
```

Reiterate: `/memory/context` (+ delegated `/agent/query`) is the default for
everything. `/memory/sql` is the rare exception for true aggregations only.

---

## INGEST — Files from `data/sources/`

The repo has a `data/sources/` directory for local files. To ingest a file (reads content, hashes it, counts words, creates a datasource entity):

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/entities/datasources/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"file_path": "data/sources/article.md", "keywords": ["finance","ml"], "importance": 0.7, "source": "document"}'
```

`file_path` is resolved relative to the container working directory (the repo root mounted at `/app`), so `data/sources/article.md` works. Absolute paths also work if mounted.

For auto-ingest on new files, nothing to run — the `watcher` sidecar container polls `data/sources/` every ~7s and ingests new files automatically, then runs the agent-driven fact-extraction pipeline (see `braindb/ingest_watcher.py`). Drop a file into `data/sources/` and it just works; watch progress with `docker logs braindb_watcher -f`.

---

## Error Handling

- If BrainDB is **unreachable** (connection refused): proceed without memory. Do not error out or keep retrying.
- If a **save fails** (400/500): move on. Do not block the conversation over a failed save.
- If the API **returns empty results**: that's normal for a new database. Save what you learn — future recalls will find it.
