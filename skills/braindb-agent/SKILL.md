## BrainDB Memory Agent

BrainDB has its own internal agent (LiteLLM + NVIDIA NIM) that handles all memory operations. You don't call individual endpoints — you ask the agent in plain English via one endpoint: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query`.

### Health check:
!`curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "OK" || echo "BRAINDB_DOWN"`

**If the output contains `BRAINDB_DOWN`**, the memory database is not running. Do this:

1. **Ask the user**: "BrainDB isn't running. Do you want me to start it for you?"
2. **Find the braindb repo** — look for a directory that has ALL of these:
   - `docker-compose.yml` at the root
   - `braindb/main.py`
   - `pyproject.toml` with `name = "braindb"`
   Search in: current dir, parent dirs (up to 3 levels), common locations like `~/source/repos/**/braindb/`.
3. **Start it**: `cd <braindb-path> && docker compose up -d`
4. **Cache the path**: `echo "<braindb-path>" > ~/.claude/skills/braindb-agent/.repo_path`
5. **Wait for it**: poll `curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health` for up to 30 seconds.
6. If healthy, proceed. If the user declines or start fails, proceed WITHOUT memory.

## TOOL PRIORITY

The agent already uses the sophisticated retrieval (keyword-embedding + graph
+ ranking) and can delegate to subagents. Phrase requests as goals ("find /
recall / understand …", "delegate a deep investigation of …"). **Do not tell
it to "run SQL"** for recall or understanding — raw SQL discards the graph and
embeddings. SQL is only ever for an explicit aggregate ("how many facts per
source?"), which you can simply ask for in plain English anyway.

Internally the agent now researches from **short previews** and reads a full
body only by id (paging large ones, or delegating big documents to a
subagent), so its context stays clean — just ask in natural language ("read
and summarise datasource X"); it handles the chunking itself.

## RECALL — at conversation start, and whenever you need context

Ask the agent in natural language. It handles keyword formulation, multi-query search, graph traversal, and summarization.

> **Encoding note**: When constructing the curl JSON body, use ASCII characters only — plain hyphens (`-`), straight quotes (`"`, `'`), no em-dashes (`—`) or smart quotes. On Windows shells these get mangled in the JSON body and the server returns 400 Bad Request.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Tell me who the user is - role, expertise, preferences, recent projects."}'
```

For topic-specific recall:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"What do you know about the user React frontend experience?"}'
```

**Read the `answer` field** from the response. Use the summary to inform your response. Never paste raw JSON into the conversation.

---

## SAVE — after learning something new

Describe what you learned in natural language. The agent decides the entity type, picks keywords, generates embeddings, creates relations.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Save: the user just told me they prefer simple code over abstractions. Source: user-stated. Connect to existing preference entities."}'
```

**Be proactive**: save user profile info, expertise, preferences, decisions, inferences you make about their working style. When in doubt, save it.

## Example queries

| Situation | Query to send to the agent |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Start of conversation | `"Tell me who the user is - role, expertise, preferences, recent projects."` |
| User mentions a topic | `"What do you know about the user ML experience and AI projects?"` |
| User shares a fact | `"Save: user is working on the IR pipeline multilingual extraction. Connect to existing IR entities."` |
| User gives a preference | `"Save as rule: always prefer simple code over abstractions. Source: user-stated. Category: behavior."` |
| User asks about past work | `"What has the user shipped recently? Check facts with source=user-stated from the last month."` |
| Need to find duplicates | `"Find near-duplicate entities in memory."` |
| Explore the graph | `"What are the densest topics in memory? Which entities have the most connections?"` |

## Delegation — ask the agent to spawn a subagent for focused work

To keep the agent's main context clean and your conversation uncluttered, you can explicitly tell it to delegate heavy tasks. Just include "use a subagent" or "delegate this" in the query — the agent has a `delegate_to_subagent` tool that runs a fresh agent instance in its own context and returns only a summary.

### When to delegate

- Deep searches or graph exploration
- Duplicate detection, orphan cleanup, bulk relation work
- Any task that would produce a lot of intermediate tool output

### Examples

```bash
# Find duplicates without seeing intermediate results
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Delegate to a subagent: find near-duplicate facts and return top 10 pairs with their IDs."}'

# Deep search on a topic
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Use a subagent: explore every entity tagged with investor-relations and return a clean summary of what is there."}'

# Create relations in bulk
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agent/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Spawn a subagent: find orphaned user-profile facts and create tagged_with links to relevant keyword entities."}'
```

Delegation is 1 level deep — subagents cannot spawn more subagents.

---

## Verbose mode — watch the agent work in real time

Set `AGENT_VERBOSE=true` in the server's `.env` (default is `false`). When enabled, every tool call the agent makes is logged to stdout with args and result preview. Watch it live:

```bash
docker logs braindb_api -f
```

The HTTP response itself is unchanged (just `{"answer": "..."}`). Logs go to the server stdout only — clean separation between the response payload and operational logging.

---

## Error handling

- If the agent call fails (connection refused, 500, timeout): proceed WITHOUT memory. Don't retry, don't block the conversation.
- If the answer mentions an ERROR: the agent tried but some tool failed. Carry on — use whatever partial information came back.
- Agent calls can take 5-30 seconds (LLM + multi-turn loop). Subagent calls can take 30-90 seconds. That's normal.
