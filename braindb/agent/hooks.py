"""Runtime nudge: tell the LLM to finalise when it's about to run out of turns.

WHY this exists
---------------
The strict typed-final contract (`final_answer` tool with a Pydantic argument
schema, no `output_type` on the Agent — see `braindb/agent/agent.py`) raises a
`RuntimeError` if the model ends a run without calling `final_answer`. Weak
or quantised models sometimes over-explore (chaining `recall_memory` /
`delegate_to_subagent` calls beyond what's necessary) and reach
`max_turns` without ever submitting. The strict path correctly catches this
as a failure, but we'd rather give the model a fighting chance: shortly
before `max_turns` is exhausted, inject a chat message reminding it to
finalise.

HOW the nudge gets into the conversation
-----------------------------------------
The openai-agents SDK's `RunHooks.on_llm_start` callback (see
`agents/lifecycle.py`) receives the mutable `input_items` list that's about
to be sent to the LLM. Appending one item to that list adds a synthetic
user message visible to the model on its NEXT turn. That's the same
mechanism the SDK uses internally for any added context. We exploit it
exactly once per run (idempotent), at the configured threshold.

Knobs (see `braindb/config.py`)
- `agent_countdown_threshold` (default 5): how many turns before
  `max_turns` we start nudging. Set to 0 to disable the nudge entirely.

Design constraints
- One nudge per run (no spam).
- Defensive: any internal error in the hook is caught and logged, never
  re-raised — a future SDK shape change must not bring down agent runs.
- Pure on-LLM-start counting — no SDK-private state inspection.

class CountdownHooks(RunHooks):
    """Mutates `input_items` to inject up to TWO independent nudges:

    1. Turn-budget nudge ("you have N turns left, finalise") — fires when
       the agent is close to exhausting `max_turns`. Original behaviour;
       see module docstring.

    2. Token-budget nudge ("context is filling up, call handoff_to_successor")
       — fires ONLY when `token_budget > 0` AND the cheap token estimate
       of `input_items` (sum-of-content-chars / 4) exceeds the budget.
       Writer-only: callers that don't set `token_budget` get the
       original turn-only behaviour. The two nudges have independent
       fired-once flags so one cannot suppress the other.

    Lifecycle (per run):
      - constructed once with knobs (turn-related + optional token-related).
      - `on_llm_start` fires before each LLM call.
        - increments `_turns`; if `_turns >= max_turns - threshold` AND
          `_fired_turns` is False, appends the turn nudge.
        - if `token_budget > 0` AND
          `estimated_tokens(input_items) > token_budget` AND
          `_fired_tokens` is False, appends the handoff nudge.
      - each nudge fires at most once per run.

    Disabled paths:
      - `threshold <= 0` disables the turn nudge (existing safety hatch).
      - `token_budget <= 0` disables the handoff nudge (default; non-writer
        callers don't pass this).

          threshold 8 fires the nudge at turn 12, with 8 turns still to
          spend). Deep-research models like Qwen do better when given
          a "begin concluding" signal rather than a hard stop — they
          can do one or two focused gap-filling calls before
          `final_answer` instead of slamming tools shut mid-thread.

        - HARD (max_turns ≤ 5): "call `final_answer` NOW". Used when

          (`max_turns=3`), where the retry is explicitly a "you forgot
          to finalise, please call the tool now" correction. The
          model gets the unambiguous instruction without ambiguity
          about wrapping up vs investigating further.

        Why pick the tone from `max_turns` rather than an explicit
        constructor flag: the retry call site already passes its own
        `max_turns=settings.agent_retry_max_turns` (3) and the main
        run passes the general `max_turns` (20). The two contexts
