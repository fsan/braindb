"""
Typed agent output contract.

Convention (absolute): every agent/subagent finishes via the `final_answer`
trick, and its payload is ALWAYS one of these Pydantic models — never a loose
free string we scrape. `@function_tool` turns the model into a strict JSON
schema for the tool arguments, so the LLM is constrained to emit valid
structured output instead of free-running and truncating.

These mirror the style of `braindb/schemas/` (the REST layer); they reuse the
existing pydantic dependency — no new dependency, no new machinery.

# Coercion helpers — weak/quantised models often emit "" (empty string) for
# nullable fields instead of `null`, or `null` for empty-list fields instead
# of `[]`. The Pydantic schemas are nullable + defaulted at the type level;
# these `before` validators just accept the wrong-type variants gracefully
# so we don't reject a perfectly intended "skip" decision because the model
# sent `target_wiki_no=""` instead of `null`. The validation contract is
# unchanged — we still produce a properly-typed Pydantic instance.


# Top-level coercion — some providers (notably vLLM / Qwen) emit tool-call
# `arguments.payload` as a JSON-encoded STRING ("{\"action\": \"skip\", ...}")
# instead of a JSON object ({"action": "skip", ...}). This is technically
# OpenAI-spec-compliant (the outer `arguments` field IS defined as a string
# of JSON), but the SDK only unwraps once and then hands the inner value to
# Pydantic as-is — so when the inner value is itself a JSON string, Pydantic
# rejects it with "Input should be a valid dictionary".
#
# The `@model_validator(mode="before")` below catches this case: if the input
# is a string that parses as JSON to a dict, we use the parsed dict; if it
# parses to anything else (list / int / null), we let Pydantic raise its
# usual "valid dictionary" error so the LLM sees a clear correction. Dict
# inputs are passed through untouched — well-behaved providers (deepinfra,
# OpenAI, Anthropic via LiteLLM) see exactly the same behaviour as today.
#
# This is the SAME pattern as the nullable-field coercion above, just at the
# whole-model level rather than per-field. The LLM-visible schema is
# unchanged; we don't advertise string-form acceptance to the model.
