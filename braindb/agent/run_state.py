"""
Per-run side-channel for the agent's final structured payload.

Why this exists: `Agent(output_type=<PydanticModel>)` makes the SDK pass
`response_format: json_schema` on EVERY LLM call (not just the final
one), which steers weaker models to satisfy the schema on turn 1 and
skip tools entirely. We therefore build agents WITHOUT `output_type` so
intermediate turns are free — but then `StopAtTools` would `str()`-coerce
the stop-tool's return into `result.final_output`, and we'd lose the
typed instance.

This module is the bridge: each `submit_*` tool body parks the
SDK-validated payload via `record_submit(payload)`; `run_typed` reads it
back via `slot.value` after `Runner.run` returns.

## Why a mutable slot, not just `ContextVar[Any]`

ContextVar values are inherited by reference into child asyncio Tasks,
but `.set()` inside a child Task does NOT propagate up to the parent.
The openai-agents SDK runs tool bodies (including parallel-tool batches)
inside such child Tasks, so a naive `last_submit.set(payload)` in the
tool body is invisible to the surrounding `run_typed`. Putting a mutable
container in the ContextVar instead — and mutating its `.value` from the
tool — works across that boundary because every Task sees the same
object reference. The standard `set(slot) + reset(token)` lifecycle in
`run_typed` keeps nested runs (parent → `delegate_to_subagent` →
subagent) isolated: each level uses its own `_Slot`.
