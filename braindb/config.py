    # remaining (open) slots in `final_rank` order and gives each new
    # dominant keyword a halving slot allowance (50% / 25% / 12.5% ...
    # of max_results, floor 1). Stops one popular keyword (e.g.
    # `user-profile`) from monopolising the open portion.

    # fires — that's fine because the small-context path fails at
    # initial prompt construction long before the handoff can help.
