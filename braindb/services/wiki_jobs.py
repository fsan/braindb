"""
Wiki job queue — non-destructive plumbing only.

This module is deliberately free of any search/scoring/LLM logic (constraint
C3): finding *what* to wiki-ify and *how* to write it is delegated to the
existing recall/agent infra by the routers. Here we only:

  * detect orphans with one read-only SQL pass (no scoring),
  * enqueue exactly one `triage` job per orphan (idempotent),
  * list jobs.

Claim / status-transition / advisory-lock / accounted-change-gate helpers are
added in later steps, alongside the endpoints that use them.
