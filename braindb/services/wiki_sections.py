"""Section-level operations on wiki markdown bodies.

Wiki bodies live as one markdown blob in `entities.content`. This module
parses, splices, and validates them at the section level so the writer
agent can edit ONE section at a time instead of rewriting the whole
body — the fix for big-wiki context exhaustion on smaller-context
models (see plan: read-write tools / handoff).

Sections are anchored on `<!-- section:NAME -->` HTML-comment markers
that the writer prompt already mandates (see `wiki_writer_prompt.md`
"Recommended structure"). Everything before the first marker is the
HEADER (meta-comment + `# Title` + `> **Summary:** ...` callout) and
is preserved verbatim by all splice operations.

Optimistic concurrency: every read returns the wiki's current
`wikis_ext.revision`. Every write requires the caller to pass that
revision back as `expect_revision`. A mismatch raises
`StaleRevisionError` so the caller re-reads and retries instead of
silently stomping on a concurrent edit.

Pure parsing functions (`parse_sections`, `splice_section`,
`delete_section`, `check_grammar`) are DB-free and unit-testable.
The two DB helpers at the bottom (`fetch_wiki_for_section_op`,
`apply_section_write`) are the only stateful surface.
